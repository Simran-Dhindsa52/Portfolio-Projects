Simrandeep's Developer Portfolio
Welcome to my project portfolio! This repository contains a collection of web development projects that I’ve built to practice and showcase my skills in frontend and backend development.

🧩 About
I’m a software developer with a strong focus on building interactive, responsive, and user-friendly applications. Most of the projects here are frontend-based, using modern technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Tailwind CSS. I also work with C# for backend development and desktop applications. You’ll find backend-focused projects built with Node.js, Express, C#, and SQL/NoSQL databases to demonstrate my full-stack capabilities.
